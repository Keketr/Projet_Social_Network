Update your MySQL client: Make sure you are using a version of the MySQL client that supports the caching_sha2_password authentication protocol. You may need to update your MySQL client library or driver.

Change the server authentication mode: If a client update is not possible, you can change the authentication mode on the MySQL server for the user account you are using. To do this, run the following command in your MySQL server:
`ALTER USER 'votre_nom_utilisateur'@'votre_h√¥te' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' BY 'your_password';` replace it by your personnal informations.
8. If you encounter a problem like that : `(ER_NOT_SUPPORTED_AUTH_MODE)`, please use this command  on the terminal MYSQL to update the package MYSQL
`npm install mysql2 --save`

Change authentication plugin for MySQL user : 

`ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH 'mysql_native_password' BY 'your_passaword';
